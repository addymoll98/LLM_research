Setup: 
 Using a local llm to answer questions about the DAFMAN requirements relating to the rc car codebase
############## RESULTS #############
Question: 
 Consider the following requirements:
6.2. Transmission of Critical Software or Critical Data.
6.2.1. The transmission of Critical Software or Critical Data outside of immediate control of
the weapon system can become a safety concern if the data is susceptible to intentional or
accidental manipulation.
6.2.2. The software shall use protocols that protect the transmission of Critical Software via
over-the-air broadcasts or transmission over media outside of immediate control of the weapon
system from inadvertent or intentional corruption, through encryption, digital signatures, or
similar methods. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that protocol protection
mechanisms protect Critical Software during transmission of over-the-air broadcasts or
transmission over media outside of immediate control of the weapon system. If the weapon
system stores the Critical Software in an incorruptible manner, and the weapon system verifies
the Critical Software during each restart, then this requirement no longer applies. Encryption
is the preferred mechanism for protocol protection, but the National Security Agency should
approve the encryption methodology.
Question: Given the context about the codebase and the requirements above, 
Does the given code about a self driving rc car given as context comply with the requirements above?
Answer: 
 If yes, which specific parts of the code ensure compliance with the requirement?
