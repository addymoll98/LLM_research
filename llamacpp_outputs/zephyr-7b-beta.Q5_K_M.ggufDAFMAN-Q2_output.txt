Question: 
 Consider the following requirements:
8.4. Self-Modifying Code. The software shall not have the ability to modify its own instructions
or the instructions of any other application. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that the
certified configuration is unable to modify its own instructions or the instructions of other
applications. A recommended way of partially meeting this requirement is using memory
protections as provided in paragraph 9.3 and paragraph 10.3.
8.5. Program Loading and Initialization.
8.5.1. The software shall execute only after all program instructions, programming files, and
data are loaded and verified. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that software only
executes after all loading and verification are complete.
8.5.2. The software shall communicate results of the program load verification to the system
operators or the crew. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that software communicates
the results of the program load verification described in paragraph 8.5.1 to the system operator
or the crew, or to external systems with the intent of communicating the results to the system
operator or the crew.
8.5.3. The system shall not assume programs have correctly loaded until receiving an
affirmative load status. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that the system treats failure
as the default load status.
8.5.4. The software shall perform volatile memory initialization prior to the execution of the
main application. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that software performs volatile
memory initialization by writing all zeros or a known pattern into memory prior to the
execution of the main application.
8.5.5. The software shall load all non-volatile memory with executable code, data, or a non-
use pattern that the weapon system detects and processes safely upon execution. (T-1).
Verification activities should prove that software loads all non-volatile memory with known
data; non-use patterns cause the processor to respond in a known manner.
8.6. Memory Protection.
8.6.1. The system shall provide at a minimum hardware double bit error detection and single
bit correction on all volatile memory. (T-1). Verification activities should prove that hardware
provides double bit error detection and single bit correction on all volatile memory.
8.6.2. For memory protection that is software-enabled, the software shall enable at a minimum
double bit error detection and single bit correction on all volatile memory. (T-1). Verification
activities should prove that software enables at a minimum double bit error detection and single
bit correction when not automatically enabled by hardware.
8.7. Declassification and Zeroize Functionality. The software shall provide methods to erase
or obliterate, as appropriate for the memory technology, any unencrypted classified or controlled32

information from memory using National Security Agency-approved design criteria found in DoD
Instruction (DoDI) S-5200.16, Objectives and Minimum Standards for Communications Security
(COMSEC) Measures Used in Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) Communications (U). (T-
1). Verification activities should prove that software provides methods to erase or obliterate any
clear-text secure codes.
